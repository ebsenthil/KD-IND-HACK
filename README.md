# 🧠 Inventory Forecasting System with MLOps and LLMOps

This repository presents a hybrid system that integrates **MLOps** and **LLMOps** practices to forecast product inventory needs in the retail industry using both internal (sales) and external (weather, holiday, disaster) data.

## 🏬 Data Sources

- **Retail Stores**: Provide daily sales data (e.g., product SKUs, quantities, dates).
- **External Events**: Include holidays, policy changes, strikes, weather, and natural disasters.

---

## 🔄 Data Ingestion & Collection

- **Daily Sales Data**: Gathered from retail stores.
- **External Data**: Retrieved through a multi-agent workflow powered by LLMOps, calling APIs for:
  - Weather forecasts
  - Holiday calendars
  - Disaster alerts
  - Economic events

---

## ⚙️ MLOps Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleans and formats raw sales and external event data.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Merges internal and external data into a feature-rich dataset.
   - Applies feature engineering (e.g., flags for `is_holiday`, `disaster_severity`, `weather_event`).

3. **Model Development**:
   - Uses XGBoost or other models to learn sales patterns.
   - Evaluates and stores the trained inventory forecasting model.

## 🤖 LLMOps & Multi-Agent Workflow

- Users interact with the system through a **LangGraph multi-agent interface**.
- Agents gather contextual data via API calls (e.g., weather on a future date).
- These agents feed real-time data into the prediction pipeline, enabling on-demand inventory forecasts.

---

## 🔁 Automation & Optimization

- **MLOps** handles:
  - Automation of pipelines
  - Continuous model training
  - Monitoring and retraining based on drift

- **LLMOps** handles:
  - Coordination of agents for external insights
  - Intelligent response generation
  - Orchestration of tool-based workflows

---

## ✅ Key Benefits

- Accurate, real-time, **context-aware inventory forecasting**
- Reduces risk of overstocking or understocking
- Fully **automated** and **scalable**
- Supports **multi-agent AI orchestration**
